### **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**

| **Aspect**                   | **Details**                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Description**              | IDOR is a vulnerability that occurs when an application exposes internal implementation objects, such as files or database records, through user-supplied input. This can allow an attacker to access or manipulate resources they should not have permission to. |
| **Conditions to be Vulnerable** | - Direct access to objects via user-controlled input without proper authorization checks. <br> - Lack of security measures to validate user permissions for accessing objects. |
| **Where to Find**            | - URL parameters that reference user data (e.g., `http://example.com/profile.php?id=123`). <br> - API endpoints allowing access to sensitive data without adequate authentication. |
| **Common Exploits**          | - **Accessing another user's profile**: An attacker modifies the ID in the URL to view or edit someone else's profile (e.g., changing `id=123` to `id=124`). <br> - **Manipulating order details**: By changing the order ID in the URL, an attacker can view other users' orders or details (e.g., `http://example.com/order.php?id=456`). |
| **Mitigation**               | - Implement proper authorization checks to ensure users can only access resources they own. <br> - Avoid exposing internal identifiers in URLs. Use indirect references (e.g., hash-based IDs) instead. |
| **Example**                  | An attacker accesses a URL `http://example.com/user/profile?id=5`, which should belong to a specific user. By changing the ID, they access the profiles of other users, leading to data exposure. |

### **Common Bypass Techniques and Payloads**

| **Bypass Technique**                | **Payload**                                    |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Changing Object ID**              | `http://example.com/resource?id=2` to `id=3` |
| **Sequential Access**               | Accessing `http://example.com/resource?id=1`, `id=2`, etc. |
| **Accessing Related Resources**     | `http://example.com/resource?id=1&related=2` |
| **Guessing IDs**                    | Using common patterns or sequential IDs (e.g., `1, 2, 3, ...`). |
| **API Manipulation**                | Modifying request parameters in API calls to access unauthorized resources. |
